## Introduction

This tutorial is designed to guide you through connecting any ESP development module to a Bluetooth game controller. Specifically, we will demonstrate using a wireless Xbox controller with the ESP32-S3 dev module to control a robotic arm. The primary objective is to establish a connection between the controller and the ESP module, enabling you to read all inputs effectively.

The motivation behind this tutorial is to provide a practical example of integrating Bluetooth game controllers with ESP modules, showcasing their potential in robotics and other applications. By following this tutorial, readers will gain hands-on experience in setting up and configuring the hardware and software, ultimately enhancing their understanding of Bluetooth communication and control systems.

### Learning Objectives

- Bluetooth Communication: Understanding how to establish a Bluetooth connection between the ESP32-S3 and a game controller.
- ESP32-S3 Configuration: Setting up the ESP32-S3 development module for Bluetooth communication.
- Controller Input Reading: Learning how to read inputs from a wireless Xbox controller.
- Firmware Development: Writing and configuring firmware to handle Bluetooth communication and input processing.
- Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving common issues in Bluetooth communication and hardware setup.

Any additional notes from the developers can be included here.
